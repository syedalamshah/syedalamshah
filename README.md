## 🚀 About Me

I am a dedicated student pursuing a Bachelor’s in Artificial Intelligence, with a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and hands-on experience in Java, C++, and SQL. My current learning journey is focused on Python for AI development, with a special interest in agentic AI systems and agentic architectures.

I am passionate about solving complex problems, writing clean and efficient code, and exploring how artificial intelligence—especially intelligent agents—can drive real-world impact. I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects, contribute to open-source, and gain professional experience in AI and software engineering.
